# SimpleExpressions

A Java based Regular Expression Engine. Probably dating back to 2007. FOR ILLUSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY.

I originally build this regular expression library for use in my SimpleEdit IDE. Compared to the then-standard implementation, it was faster in some aspects at the expense of not supporting some concepts that were not needed for the purpose.
However, I'm not sure what limitations it had.

Do not use this in production. The code shared here is useful if you want to understand how a basic regular expression engine works but it is not intended to be used in production.
